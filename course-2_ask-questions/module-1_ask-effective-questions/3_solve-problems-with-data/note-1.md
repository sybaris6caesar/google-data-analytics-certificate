Data analysts work with a variety of problems.

These include: making predictions, categorizing things, spotting something unusual, identifying themes, discovering connections, and finding patterns.

Making Predictions: This problem type involves using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future.

Categorizing Things: This means assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features.
An example of this problem type is a manufacturer that reviews data on shop floor employee performance.
A group for employees who are most and least effective at repair and maintenance, most and least effective at assembly, and many more groups or clusters.

Spotting Something Unusual: In this problem type, data analysts identify data that is different from the norm.

Identifying themes:  takes categorization as a step further by grouping information into broader concepts.
Going back to our manufacturer that has just reviewed data on the shop floor employees.
But now a data analyst could take those categories and group them into the broader concept of low productivity and high productivity.
This would make it possible for the business to see who is most and least productive, in order to reward top performers and provide additional support to those workers who need more training.

Discovering connections: enables data analysts to find similar challenges faced by different entities, and then combine data and insights to address them.
Here's what I mean; say a scooter company is experiencing an issue with the wheels it gets from its wheel supplier.
That company would have to stop production until it could get safe, quality wheels back in stock.
But meanwhile, the wheel companies encountering the problem with the rubber it uses to make wheels, turns out its rubber supplier could not find the right materials either.

Finding Patterns: Data analysts use data to find patterns by using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again.
