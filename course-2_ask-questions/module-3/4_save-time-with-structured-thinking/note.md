Be sure to differentiate statement of work from scope of work, which are both abbreviated as SOW. Although they help define deliverables and a timeline, they aren't the same and shouldn't be used interchangeably.

A statement of work is a document that clearly identifies the products and services a vendor or contractor will provide to an organization. It includes objectives, guidelines, deliverables, schedule, and costs. 

A scope of work is project-based and sets the expectations and boundaries of a project. A scope of work may be included in a statement of work to help define project outcomes. 

As a junior data analyst, it's more typical to be asked to create a scope of work than a statement of work.
