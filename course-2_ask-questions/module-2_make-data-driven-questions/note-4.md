For a refresher, consider the different types of dashboards a business may use. Often, businesses will tailor a dashboard for a specific purpose. The three most common categories are:

Strategic: focuses on long term goals and strategies at the highest level of metrics

Operational: short-term performance tracking and intermediate goals

Analytical: consists of the datasets and the mathematics used in these sets
