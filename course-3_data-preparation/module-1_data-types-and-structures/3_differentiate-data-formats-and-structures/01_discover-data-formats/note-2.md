Structured data is data that's organized in a certain format, such as rows and columns.

As a data analyst, you'll work with a lot of structured data, which will usually be in the form of a table, spreadsheet or relational database.

But sometimes you'll come across unstructured data. This is data that is not organized in any easily identifiable manner.

Audio and video files are examples of unstructured data because there's no clear way to identify or organize their content.
