Another great way to discover if you're working with unbiased data is to bring the results to life with visualizations.

In the class example we just covered, you could visualize the number of students in the class overall, and their gender identities with a bar chart.

You could then compare that to a similar bar chart showing the students you surveyed.

This will help you easily identify any misalignment with your sample.
