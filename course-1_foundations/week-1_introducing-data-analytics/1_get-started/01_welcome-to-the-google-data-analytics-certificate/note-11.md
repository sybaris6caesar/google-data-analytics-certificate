Data analysis and data analytics sound the same, but they're actually very different things. Let's start with analysis.

You've already learned that data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

Data analytics in the simplest terms is the science of data.
It's a very broad concept that encompasses everything from the job of managing and using data to the tools and methods that data workers use each and every day.

So when you think about data, data analysis and the data ecosystem, it's important to understand that all of these things fit under the data analytics umbrella.
