Now, data science, the discipline of making data useful, is an umbrella term that encompasses three disciplines: machine learning, statistics, and analytics.


If you want to make a few important decisions under uncertainty, that is statistics.

If you want to automate, in other words, make many, many, many decisions under uncertainty, that is machine learning and AI.

But what if you don't know how many decisions you want to make before you begin? What if what you're looking for is inspiration? You want to encounter your unknown unknowns.
That is analytics.
