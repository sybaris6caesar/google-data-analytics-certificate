Data strategy is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis.

You manage people by making sure they know how to use the right data to find solutions to the problem you're working on.

For processes, it's about making sure the path to that solution is clear and accessible.
For tools, you make sure the right technology is being used for the job.
