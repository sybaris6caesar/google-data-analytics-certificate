Consider what you reviewed about the phases of data:

What is the relationship between the data life cycle and the data analysis process? How are the two processes similar? How are they different?

What is the relationship between the Ask phase of the data analysis process and the Plan phase of the data life cycle? How are they similar? How are they different?

Reflect on your learning and think about how you can apply the phases of data to future projects.

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.



* From my understanding, data life cycle is the timeline of handling of data. 
Whereas data analysis process is whole process of using data (including handling) to come with important insights for decision making. 
In my opinion the "analyze" process for both of them are similar and Data Life Cycle's "Capture" and "Manage" can be substituted by Data Analysis Process's "Process". 
But whereas Data Life Cycle in my opinion is strictly deals with data, Data Analysis also deals with conclusions from data. That's where they're dissimilar.

* "Ask" phase in Data Analysis and "Plan" phase in Data Life Cycle in my opinion deal with establishing the framework of the whole process. They are similar in the sense that they're the initial planning phase of their respective processes. But dissimilar the manner that "Ask" phase encompasses soft skills of communication with the planning process.
