Consider your learning about the steps of the data life cycle and reflect on the hiring managerâ€™s request. Review the following questions to help guide your thinking: 

* What kind of data should they gather? 

* How should they gather this data? 

* Where will the data live? How will they store the data?

* Once they have the data, how will they use it? 

* How do they keep their data secure and protected? 

* What should they do with old data? What are their options?


The ice cream company should collect sales data for of each of the ice cream flavours they offer. Other data like the time of the year and location of ice cream sales should also be included.
The ice cream company itself can collect this data.
The data would live in a database created by the company where it's collected and then stored for a period of time.
After the data has been collected, we can analyse the data with regards to various variables that affect the preference of customers. It could be time of day, season, preference by region etc. etc.
After analysis they should archive the data for if any need arises in the near future.
If after some time the data hasn't been used in any meaningful way, the ice cream company should consider destroying the data.
